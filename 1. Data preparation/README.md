# Data Preparation and Analysis

## Data Examination

In the initial phase of the project, I examined the provided data file, which contains transaction details for a retail store. Below is a summary of the fields contained in the file:

- **`transaction_id`**: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **`transaction_date`**: Date of the transaction.
- **`transaction_time`**: Time of the transaction.
- **`transaction_qty`**: Quantity of products purchased.
- **`store_id`**: Identifier for the store where the transaction occurred.
- **`store_location`**: Location of the store.
- **`product_id`**: Unique identifier for the product.
- **`unit_price`**: Price per unit of the product.
- **`product_category`**: Category of the product (e.g., *Coffee*, *Tea*).
- **`product_type`**: Type of the product (e.g., *Brewed*, *Barista Espresso*).
- **`product_detail`**: Detailed description of the product.

## Data Transformation

To prepare the data for efficient analysis, I took the following transformation steps:

1. **Add ID Columns**  
   - Ensured that each transaction, product, and store has a unique identifier (ID) to standardize the data and make querying more efficient.

2. **Create Mapping Dictionaries**  
   - Created dictionaries to map IDs to detailed descriptions for products and stores. These dictionaries serve as lookup tables, ensuring that each ID corresponds correctly to the appropriate details in the data.

3. **Validate Data Consistency**  
   - Cross-referenced the dictionaries with the transaction data to identify any discrepancies, such as missing or incorrect product or store details. This validation step was crucial for maintaining data integrity.

4. **Correct Misspelled Values**  
   - Corrected any misspelled values in the product and store details to ensure consistency across all entries. This helped prevent potential errors during data analysis that could have led to incorrect insights.

5. **Replace Detailed Descriptions with IDs**  
   - Replaced the detailed descriptions in the transaction data with the corresponding IDs for products and stores, standardizing the data for optimal querying.

6. **Save the Updated Data**  
   - Saved the updated data in a structured format, ensuring it was properly prepared and optimized for the next phases of the project.

## Data Quality Issues

During the examination, I identified the following potential data quality issues:

- **Missing Values**: Some fields, such as `product_detail`, may contain missing or incomplete information.
- **Inconsistent Formatting**: The `transaction_time` field may have inconsistent formatting that needs to be standardized.
- **Duplicate Entries**: There may be duplicate transactions that need to be identified and removed.

## Next Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**: Address the identified data quality issues by filling in missing values, standardizing formats, and removing duplicates.
2. **Data Integration**: Integrate this dataset with other relevant datasets (e.g., customer data, inventory data) to enrich the analysis.
3. **Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, patterns, and insights from the prepared data.
